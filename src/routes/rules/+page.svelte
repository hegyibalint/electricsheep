	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Main Goal</h3>
	<p>
		Try to tell if your opponent is a robot or a human player, while trying to convince them that
		you're a robot.
	</p>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Game mechanic</h3>
	<p>
		Chats are made of 10 turns per player. Messages can be sent in turns only. Once you are
		confident of the identity of your opponent, press the respective button below the chat to set
		your guess.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once both players have guessed or the 10 turns are over, you will discover the identity of your
		opponent and points are assigned.
	</p>
	<p>No guess is automatic failure.</p>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Point system</h3>
	<p>
		You get one point by guessing if your opponent is an AI or a real player, and another point if
		your opponent guesses your identity wrong.
